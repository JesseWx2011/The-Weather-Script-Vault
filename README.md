# **The Weather Python Vault**



###### **Welcome to My Weather Python Vault, and thank you for coming to check it out! This is a place to store some python scripts I enjoy using, and you can use it too, under The *Apache 2.0 License*. Here is a list of the available Python Scripts (divided into categories) that you can use!**



## **SATELLITE**



##### **Using** [***goes2go***](https://github.com/blaylockbk/goes2go)**, we can pull Satellite Images at an ease.**



**Currently Available to use scripts:**



* [**GoesGIFCompiler.py**](https://github.com/JesseWx2011/The-Weather-Script-Vault/blob/master/SATELLITE/GoesGIFCompiler.py)



**This script compiles a GIF Animation using *goes2go*, by producing a plot of multiple satellite images given within a specified period of time.**

## **NEXRAD**



##### **NEXRAD Scripts will usually use** [***Py-ART***](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/) **and pulls NEXRAD Data from** [***The UniData Level II Radar Archive***](https://unidata-nexrad-level2.s3.amazonaws.com)**.**



**Currently Available to use scripts:**



* **Level2Old.py**



**This script creates an image of older NEXRAD Data, it looks like a cool weather graphic. Very customizable, and useful hopefully.**



* **Level2New.py**



**Same thing as above, but handling newer data under V06 format. This handles radar data dated after 2008.**

## **That's It!**



**Thank you for checking out this repository, hopefully it can be used for creating weather graphics. Feel free to improve the code if necessary!**
